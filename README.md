# SPEER

Demo for a Publish/Subscribe system over UDP which does Subscriber Offloading (Home Broker Change).

# Depdendencies

* Python 3
* Virtualenv
* Bash

# Installation

    # Get source
    git clone git@github.com:JonasGroeger/SPEER.git
    cd SPEER
    
    # Create virtualenv
    virtualenv venv # Assuming Python3
    source venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install dependencies into virtualenv
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# Starting the whole thing

    # This Terminal: Publishers
    ./start_publishers
    
    # New Terminal: Subscribers
    cd SPEER
    source venv/bin/activate
    ./start_subscribers
    
    # New Terminal: Brokers
    cd SPEER
    source venv/bin/activate
    ./start_brokers

# Stopping the whole thing

Since the shell scripts start the processes in the background (publishers, brokers), there is a kill script that kills **ALL** Python 3 processes called killall-python3`. Only run this if you know what you are doing.

    ./killall-python3
